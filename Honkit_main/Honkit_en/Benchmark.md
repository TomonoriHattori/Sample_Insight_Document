2. Select the execution environment.<br>
   Image search and voice search query processing, and reranking are models that do not support FP16. All other models for text registration, image registration, voice registration, OCR, and voice recognition support FP16. All models targeted for benchmarking are FP16 models. Therefore, please change the item above for "Execution Environment (FP16 Supported Models)."<br>
