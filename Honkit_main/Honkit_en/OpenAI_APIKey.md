# How to Obtain an OpenAI API Key
To use OpenAI's features within "ailia DX insight," you need to obtain an API key from OpenAI.<br>
Furthermore, OpenAI sets [rate limits](RateLimits.md), so it is recommended to raise the rate limit ceiling, especially if used by multiple people. This requires a certain number of days (minimum of 7 days) to pass, so prompt action is necessary.

## Create an OpenAI Account
1. Select "Sign up" from the [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview).<br>
