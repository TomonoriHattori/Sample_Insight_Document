# Creating a Config File
By creating a config file, you can display the terms image when starting the application or always display the company logo.<br>
*The config file can be selected at the initial startup of ailia DX Insight.<br>


<br>
## Example of Creating a Config File
Create the config format in json.

```
{
  "apiKey" : {
    "openAI": "YourOpenAIApiKey"
  },
  "licenseFile": "/path/to/license/file",
  "terms": {
    "image": "/path/to/terms/image"
  },
  "logo": "path/to/logo/image"
}
```

`"apiKey"`<br>
Enter the OpenAI API key here.<br>
`"licenseFile"`<br>
Specify the path to the license file as a relative path from the config file.<br>
`"terms"` `"logo"`<br>
Specify the path to the image file as a relative path from the config file.

Other than the license file item, the omission of items does not affect the startup of the app.

<br>
Since settings and image files are copied locally, access to the shared folder after initial setup is not required.

## Applying the Config File / Applying the License
When ailia DX Insight is launched for the first time, a window will appear asking you to "Please select a license file or config file." Please specify the folder to apply.<br>

<br> Alternatively, you can register/update the license within the "Config File" item in the settings screen .<br> You can also unregister the config file within the same item.<br>
